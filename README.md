## Publications System

The publications page automatically fetches your research publications from Google Scholar and supports manual overrides for adding custom links and descriptions.

### Google Scholar Setup

1. Update the `SCHOLAR_ID` in `scripts/fetch_scholar.py` with your Google Scholar ID
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the fetch script: `npm run fetch-publications`

### Manual Overrides

Edit `data/publications_overrides.yml` to add custom PDF links, videos, code repositories, or descriptions:

```yaml
your-paper-slug:
  pdf_url: "https://example.com/your-paper.pdf"
  video_url: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=your-talk"
  code_url: "https://github.com/you/your-repo"
  custom_description: "Custom description override"
  featured: true
```

### Build Integration

Publications are automatically fetched during the build process. For builds without fetching (e.g., if the service is unavailable), use:

```bash
npm run build:skip-fetch
```
